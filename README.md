# Arduino-Remote-Bluetooth-Thermometer-with-OLED-Display
This is a two part project. An Arduno is connected to a TMP36 thermometer and an HC05 Bluetooth set as a Master. This sends the data to a second Arduino connected to an HC06 Slave Bluetooth and an OLED Display. Fo full instructions for this project see my Blog poast at https://rydepier.wordpress.com/2015/10/11/remote-bluetooâ€¦h-oled-display/
